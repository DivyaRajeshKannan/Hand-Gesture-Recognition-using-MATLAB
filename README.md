# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-MATLAB
Recognizing the different hand gestures and implementing them in Medical image processing for easier and less time-consuming output display. The hand gestures of numbers 1-5 are recognized using a Transfer Learning Algorithm and the Image Processing techniques Sharpening, Edge detection, Histogram, Dilation and Erosion are done on the medical image respectively.
